Mobile Digital Signage for events, meeting- and conference rooms.

Put an iPad/iPod into a mount next to the door of a meeting- or conference room, pick the according calendar on the device and have an ever up-to-date door sign.

Coonference (iTunes-Link) comes with a few out-of-the-box templates, both, as ready-to-use styles for different occasions and device sizes, as well as inspiration how to brush and style your own custom branded template.

Modify them or add more in the iTunes ‘Documents’ folder. Deleted
templates are re-created when launching the App.

Coonference relies on iOS for calendar subscription + sync (see ‘Subscribe to a calendar’ in http://support.apple.com/manuals/ or use a webcal:// URL) and uses simple HTML + javascript for display.

Leverage “Guided Access” (see http://support.apple.com/manuals/) to lock the device.
